## Tasks Still Pending

### High Priority
1. **Backend API Integration** - Connect admin and client portal to real APIs (currently using mock data)
2. **Lead Form API Endpoint** - Create unified `/api/leads` endpoint for all forms
3. **Email Notifications** - Wire up email system for lead submissions (infrastructure ready)

### Medium Priority
4. **Stripe Integration** - Complete payment processing (UI exists, backend needed)
5. **Admin Portal Pages** - Complete missing pages (Users management, Payments detail, Organizations detail)
6. **TypeScript Errors** - Fix build errors (currently using `skipLibCheck`)

---

## Assistance Needed

**None at this time** - User chose to skip notification implementation for now. Ready to continue when needed.

---

## Notes & Observations

### System Health
- Frontend UI is polished and nearly complete (~85%)
- Backend integration is the major gap (~30% complete)
- Database schema is complete, needs more real API connections
- Email/notification infrastructure is ready but not wired up

### User Preferences
- Keeping lead notifications on hold (no email/Slack for now)
- Focusing on UI/UX fixes and page structure
- Will address backend integration in future sessions

### Technical Debt
- Multiple TODOs in API routes for email notifications
- Mock data still used extensively in portal pages
- No test coverage exists yet

---

**Overall Status:** System is visually production-ready but needs significant backend work before deployment. Current focus on frontend refinements and navigation flow.
