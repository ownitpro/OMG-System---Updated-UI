# The 45-Minute Quote: How Ontario Builders Win Jobs Faster

*What if you could turn a 3-day quoting process into a 45-minute win?*

## 1️⃣ The 3-Day Quoting Trap

Picture this: It's Tuesday morning, and you're juggling three renovation estimates, responding to text messages from potential clients, and trying to remember which bathroom quote you sent to which customer. Sound familiar?

This is the reality for most GTA contractors:

- **Day 1**: Site visit, measurements, and initial assessment
- **Day 2**: Manual calculations in Excel, sourcing materials, and labor estimates
- **Day 3**: Creating the proposal, sending it out, and waiting for a response

Meanwhile, your phone keeps ringing with new inquiries, and you're falling behind on existing projects. The manual process is killing your efficiency and your profit margins.

## 2️⃣ Why Speed Wins in Construction

**The First Quote Advantage**

Here's a statistic that should change how you think about quoting: **clients accept the first credible quote 70% of the time.**

Think about it from the homeowner's perspective. They've decided to renovate their kitchen. They're excited, they have a budget, and they want to get started. The first contractor who provides a professional, detailed quote gets the job—even if they're not the cheapest.

*"By the time you reply, someone else has signed."*

Speed isn't just about efficiency; it's about capturing momentum and closing deals while the client is still engaged.
