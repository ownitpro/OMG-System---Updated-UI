  content: `# From Paper Charts to CareFlow: How Ontario Clinics Reduced Admin Time by 70%

*Every nurse in Ontario knows the pain — half your shift buried in forms, not with patients.*

## 1️⃣ The Hidden Cost of Paperwork in Care

**The Reality Check**

Clinical teams in Ontario clinics, long-term care facilities, and group homes spend 40–60% of their time on administrative tasks instead of patient care. That's not just inefficient—it's a crisis.

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- Ontario LTCs lose ~8 hours/week per staff member to redundant documentation
- Nurses spend more time on paperwork than patient interaction
- Administrative burden is the #1 reason for healthcare worker burnout

*"That time should be care time — not copy-paste time."*

## 2️⃣ Why Fragmented Systems Fail

**The Current Chaos:**

- **Paper intake forms** that get lost or damaged
- **Faxed lab results** that arrive late or incomplete
- **Manual billing entries** that lead to claim rejections
- **Four different systems** that don't communicate with each other
- **Missed vitals alerts** that create safety risks and audit penalties

**The Result:**
Staff logging into multiple systems, re-entering the same data, and constantly playing catch-up with documentation that should be automatic.

## 3️⃣ The CareFlow Solution
