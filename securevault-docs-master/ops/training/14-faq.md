## Customer-Safe Language

Common questions and approved answers for customer-facing interactions.

## Installation

### What can I install?

**Answer:**
> "You can install SecureVault Docs as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on any device, or download the desktop app for Windows, Mac, or Linux. We don't have iOS or Android native apps - use the PWA on mobile devices for the best experience."

## Team Management

### How do I invite my team?

**Answer:**
> "Go to Settings → Team & Roles, then click 'Invite Member'. Enter their email address and choose their role - Admin or Member. They'll receive an email invitation with a secure link to join your organization."

## Client Portals

### How do client portals work?

**Answer:**
> "Client portals give each client their own secure space. You create a portal, invite your client by email, and they get secure token-based access. Then you can send document requests - like KYC documents or tax packages. When the client uploads, files automatically land in your organization, organized and ready for review."

## Sharing

### Is my data watermarked when I share?

**Answer:**
> "Yes. All shared documents are displayed in a watermarked viewer. You can also set a PIN and expiry date for extra security. The watermark includes your organization information and helps protect your documents from unauthorized sharing."

### Can I revoke a share link?

**Answer:**
> "Yes, absolutely. You can revoke any share link at any time, even if it was already shared. Just go to Shares, find the link, and click 'Revoke'. Access is terminated immediately."

## Integrations

### Can I import from Google Drive or Dropbox?

**Answer:**
> "Yes. We support connectors for Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Box. Connect your account in Settings → Connectors, then use the 'Import from Drive' button to bring files into SecureVault Docs. In test mode, this is simulated, but in production, files sync automatically."

### What is Email-to-Vault?

**Answer:**
> "Email-to-Vault gives you a unique email address. Forward receipts, bills, or any documents to this address, and they automatically land in your vault with labels applied. Perfect for capturing documents on the go without opening the app."

## Billing

### What happens if I hit my monthly limit?

**Answer:**
> "You'll see alerts in your Billing page as you approach your limits - at 70, 80, 90, and 95 percent. We'll stop new uploads at 100 percent, but you can upgrade your plan anytime to increase your limits. The upgrade takes effect immediately."

### How does pricing work?

**Answer:**
> "Business plans are per-seat pricing - you pay for each team member. Personal plans are per-plan pricing - one flat rate. All prices are in USD and shown clearly on our Pricing page. You can upgrade or downgrade anytime."

## Security

### How secure is my data?

**Answer:**
> "Very secure. All connections use HTTPS encryption. Your documents are encrypted at rest. Share links use PIN protection and expiry dates. Watermark viewers prevent unauthorized sharing. We follow industry security best practices and are working toward SOC 2 certification."

### Can I export my data?

**Answer:**
> "Yes. You can export your data at any time. Go to Settings → Export to download an archive of your documents and metadata. You own your data and can take it with you anytime."

## Marketplace

### What are templates?

**Answer:**
> "Templates are ready-made vault structures you can install with one click. They include folders, labels, quick actions, and checklists. For example, the 'Personal Life Admin' template sets up folders for IDs, Bills, Receipts, and Tax documents with month-by-month organization. Browse the Marketplace to see all available templates."

### Can I preview a template before installing?

**Answer:**
> "Yes. Click 'Preview' on any template to see exactly what will be installed. You can also use 'Dry Run' to simulate the installation without making any changes. This lets you test templates safely before committing."

## Troubleshooting

### My share link isn't working

**Answer:**
> "First, check if the link has expired or if a PIN is required. Make sure you're entering the PIN correctly. If the link was revoked, you'll need a new one. Try opening the link in an incognito window to rule out browser issues. If it still doesn't work, create a new share link."

### I didn't receive my portal invite

**Answer:**
> "Check your spam folder first. If you still don't see it, we can resend the invite. Go to Client Portals, find the portal, and click 'Resend Invite'. We can also provide you with a direct portal link if needed."

## General

### Is there a mobile app?

**Answer:**
> "We don't have native iOS or Android apps, but you can install SecureVault Docs as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on any device. Just visit our website on your mobile browser and use 'Add to Home Screen' for an app-like experience."

### Can I use this offline?

**Answer:**
> "Yes, if you install the PWA or desktop app. You can view and organize documents offline, and everything syncs when you're back online. Uploads queue and process once connected."
